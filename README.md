## [Static Site Generator](https://www.boot.dev/learn/build-static-site-generator)

Ever wondered how static site generators work?

A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website of HTML and CSS files. Static sites are quite popular for blogs and other content-heavy websites because they're lightning-fast, secure, and easy to host.

A static site is what it sounds like... **static**. No matter who is interacting with the site, the content is always the same.

Some popular production-ready static site generators include:

- Eleventy
- Gatsby

### Learning Goals (Boot.dev)
- **Static Sites**: Learn about what a static site is, and start building the functionality necessary to process and move static HTML and Markdown files.
- **Nodes**: Build the core HTML generation logic that will power your static site generator. Use recursion and OOP to build an easily understandable and maintainable system.
- **Inline**: Build the inline markdown parsing logic, and the logic to generate inline HTML elements.
- **Blocks**: Handle entire blocks of markdown, and generate the HTML nodes that represent them.
- **Website**: Put the entire static site generator together, and publish your first website.
